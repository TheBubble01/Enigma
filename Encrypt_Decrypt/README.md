This repository contains two C programs; Encrypt_4_digit.c and Decrypt_4_digit.c.

Encrypt_4_digit.c is a program that prompts a user to enter a 4-digit number and encrypts the 4-digit number by; 
  (a) replacing each digit with the result of adding 7 to the digits and getting the remainder 
  after the new value is divided by 10
  (b) Then swap the second and fourth digit and also swap the first and third digit.
  Then prints the encrypted digit.

Decrypt_4_digit.c is a program that converts the encrypted 4-digit number encrypted by Encrypt_4_digit.c into the original 4-digit number entered by the user.
